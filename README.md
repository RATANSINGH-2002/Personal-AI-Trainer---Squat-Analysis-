# Smart-Mirror---Squat-Analysis-
This project aims to build, modify, and improve an existing mirror to create a multifunctional and
interactive user experience. This project uses a Raspberry PI, a two-way mirror, with an electronic
display behind the front layer of glass. The smart mirror employs embedded cameras to recognize users, 
enabling personalized interactions based on their preferences. The display will be connected to the
Raspberry Pi via an SD Card which potentially runs the Machine learning Algorithm and ensures the 
posture correct of the user for a particular exercise along with the feedback facility. This project also 
explores the potential application of smart mirrors in various sectors such as an interactive fitness coach
by integrating motion and gesture tracking. The mirror guides users throughworkouts, corrects their 
form, and provides real-time feedback. The smart mirror has the potential toreshape human interactions 
with reflective surfaces, offering an enhanced and personalized user experience that blends the physical 
and digital worlds.
