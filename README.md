**üîç Project Overview: Building an Interactive Smart Mirror**

This innovative project centers around creating a multifunctional smart mirror using a Raspberry Pi and a two-way mirror. By integrating embedded cameras, the mirror recognizes users and tailors interactions based on their preferences. Here are the key features:                                                                                                                                                           
**Hardware Setup:**
The smart mirror consists of a two-way mirror, concealing an electronic display behind its glass surface.                                                                                                        
A Raspberry Pi serves as the brain of the system, connecting to the display via an SD Card.                                                                                                                      
**Machine Learning Algorithm:**
The mirror runs a machine learning algorithm to monitor user posture during specific exercises.                                                                                                                  
Real-time feedback ensures users maintain correct form, enhancing their workout experience.                                                                                                                        
**Applications:**
Interactive Fitness Coach: The mirror guides users through workouts, correcting their form and providing personalized feedback.                                                                                        
Gesture Tracking: By integrating motion and gesture tracking, the mirror reshapes human interactions with reflective surfaces.                                                                                         
**User Experience:**
The smart mirror bridges the physical and digital realms, offering an enhanced and personalized experience.
